**Snake Game using Pygame**

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Pygame library in Python. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer with each bite. The player must avoid colliding with the walls or with the snake's own tail while trying to achieve the highest score possible.



**How to Play**

To play the game, simply run the script in Python. The game will start immediately and the snake will begin moving to the right. The player can control the snake's direction using the arrow keys on the keyboard: up, down, left, and right. The game can be paused and quit by pressing the space bar.

The player's score is displayed in the upper left corner of the screen. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, the score increases by one point. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or with its own tail. The player can restart the game by running the script again.



**Dependencies**

This game requires the Pygame library to be installed in order to run. If you don't already have Pygame installed, you can install it using pip:
pip install pygame
